# Machine-Learning-Lab-file
The repository contains the following Machine Learning algorithms implemented
from scratch without using sci-kit learn :
- Linear Regression
- Linear Regression using Normal Equation
- Decision Tree using ID3 
- Decision Tree using CART
- K nearest neighbours
- Naive bayes classifier
- Support vector machine
- K means clustering

All the datasets for each are included.

## Utility
The repository is a machine learning lab file with almost all essential algorithms 
implemented from scratch using only pandas, numpy and matplotlib. The lab file pdf
document is also included with format for each lab assignment as :
- Aim
- Theory
- Program
- Output

You can change the details in document if you aren't feeling like making your own
file for lab :)

## How to get started
You need 3 libraries to run all the code :
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

If you dont have these already the run the following code to install them :
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```
After this, you are good to go.
